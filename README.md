### Glad to see you here! &nbsp;

I am a Front-end Software Engineer passionate about making responsible, modern, and beautifully looking web apps. 💡 Completed my Master's Degree in Software Engineering at the National Aviation University in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2018. Following that, I graduated in Web and Desktop Programming from Heritage College in 2020. 🏛️🎓 
I have a diverse background in web development, including building a custom WordPress theme during my internship at B Media Shop. As a React/WordPress Web Developer on Upwork, I achieved Top Rated status with a 91% client satisfaction rate. At Mitel in the role of Front-end Software Engineer from October 2020 to September 2023, I worked on UCaaS (Unified communication as a service) web applications, served as a prime developer for a cross-platform messaging Angular component, and significantly enhanced an all-in-one collaboration app by improving performance and adding new functionality. 
Additionally, my personal projects, such as volunteering to update a website for a charity in Ottawa, creating a Covid-19 map of cases, and crafting personal blog websites for my friends before starting my corporate career showcases my passion for development and my drive to explore new technologies beyond the scope of my professional experience.

I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems ✨.
I'm currently into Front-end Web Development 🕸️ and working towards becoming Full Stack Developer, as well as on my Data Structures and Algorithms 🤓.

Joined Github **5** years ago.
